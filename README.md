📊 CicMetrics IPL 2025 - Tournament Dashboard
🎯 Project Objective
The goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive visual analysis of the IPL 2025 season. It transforms raw match data into an interactive dashboard to help users understand team standings, player impact, and match trends at a glance.

📈 Dashboard Features
Team Performance Matrix: Real-time tracking of wins, losses, and Net Run Rate (NRR).

Player Spotlight: Analysis of the Orange Cap (Runs) and Purple Cap (Wickets) leaders.

Venue Insights: Data on which stadiums favor batting first vs. chasing.

Powerplay vs. Death Overs: Breakdown of scoring rates across different match phases.

🛠️ Tools & Skills Used
Data Cleaning: Used Excel (Power Query) to remove duplicates and handle missing match data.

Data Modeling: Established relationships between Match Tables and Player Tables.

Data Visualization: Created interactive charts (Bar, Pivot, and Slicers) to allow users to filter by Team or Player.

Accounting Logic: Applied your commerce background to ensure "Data Integrity"—making sure the total runs/wickets always balance across all views.
